The line inside the box represents the median. The whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values that are not considered outliers. Outliers are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.\n #### To analyze a boxplot, you should first examine the shape of the box. If the box is symmetrical, then the data is evenly  distributed. If the box is skewed to one side or the other, then the data is not evenly distributed.\n #### Next, you should examine the length of the whiskers. If the whiskers are short, then the data is tightly clustered around the median. If the whiskers are long, then the data is more spread out.\n #### Finally, you should look for outliers. Outliers are data points that fall outside of the whiskers. They may represent errors in the data or extreme values that need to be further investigated.\n #### Overall, boxplots are a useful tool for analyzing data and identifying patterns and trends. By examining the shape, length of whiskers, and outliers, you can gain insight into the distribution of your data and make informed decisions based on your findings.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"counts =  df8[\"SUMMARY\"].value_counts()\ncounts","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-19T19:49:50.603257Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-19T19:49:50.603973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-19T19:49:50.618634Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-19T19:49:50.603939Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-19T19:49:50.617758Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 16))\n# Create a new figure with a size of 12 inches in width and 16 inches in height.\n\nsns.boxplot(x=df8['SUMMARY'], y=df8['HUMIDITY'])\n# Create a box plot using seaborn (sns) where the x-values are taken from the 'SUMMARY' column of `df8` and the y-values are taken from the 'HUMIDITY' column.\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=90, fontsize=12, color='darkblue')\n# Rotate the x-axis tick labels by 90 degrees to avoid overlapping.

We can see some points that are having higher temperature than the maximum of the rain boxplot which are outliers. Similarly there are some outliers with the temperature under -10 C.
